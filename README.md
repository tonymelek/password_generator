## How it works?
1. User is prompted to enter password criteria
2. User Input is validated
3. for each character in the password , select randomly a character type of which the user selected and generate a random character to this type
4. check if al user selected character types have been included in the generated password.
5. Display password on screen.
## Why do we need to have a randomly generated long password?
For security purposes, you are advised not to use your password in two different places and they also need to be ong and complicated and hard to guess.
So, you need to have a password manager like (google passwords or last password) and have a known complex master password for the password manager where all your passwords are stored.
